## About Creators

### doamatto - Lead Designer, Developer
Based in California, I’m a high school student who works on making tools for people, not products. I strive to give people tools that empower them to do amazing things. To empower people there’s two things that I’m always consistent with from tool to tool: the way a user interacts with the tool is simple, but powerful and that privacy is given by default. _[Click here to go to Matt's Site](https://doamatto.xyz)_

### Rainpelt29 - Co-Designer
Based in Michigan, I’m an almost highschooler with a creative and ever-working mind. I am always working on creative visions to bring new ideas and sometimes worlds to life using film and video. My goal with all of these is the same. Make something that people will enjoy. And in anything I work on, I make sure that goal is met. _[Click here to go to Ethan's Site](https://rainpelt29.github.io/rainpelt29site)_
