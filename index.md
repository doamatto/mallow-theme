# About Creators

### doamatto - Lead Designer, Developer
Based in California, I’m a high school student that makes overly complicated tools for very simple problems. I’ve been working towards making more tools and contributing to more projects that help empower others into making their ideas into a reality. This has ranged from web templates to one-click servers and contributing to medical tools. There’s always two things that are consistent when going from app to app: the clean, modern design and the security and privacy given by default.

I have skills in **graphic design**, **software development**, **web development**, and **audio and video editing.** I’m picking up **3D modeling** and **visual effects.** My projects page, [which can be viewed here](https://doamatto.xyz/projects), has plenty of links on archived, current, and concept projects.

I’ve been gaining an interest in homelabbing, privacy-focused tools that also use green energy, coalitions, Linux, and jailbreaking/rooting.

### Rainpelt29 - Co-Designer
Based in Michigan, I’m an *almost* highschooler with a creative and ever-working mind. I am always working on creative visions to bring new ideas and sometimes worlds to life using film and video. My goal with all of these is the same. Make something that people will enjoy. And in anything I work on, I make sure that goal is met.

I have skills in areas of **script writing, graphic design, video editing, business management,** as well as am learning and improving my skills in **3D animation** and **VFX**. [You can look at my current projects here.](https://rainpelt29.github.io/projects)

Outside of doing lots of work, I do enjoy lots of memes and video games with a healthy dose of cooking, reading, watching tv, and dare I say a little art?
