# About Creators

### doamatto - Lead Designer, Developer
Based in California, I’m a high school student that makes overly complicated tools for very simple problems. I’ve been working towards making more tools and contributing to more projects that help empower others into making their ideas into a reality. This has ranged from web templates to one-click servers and contributing to medical tools. There’s always two things that are consistent when going from app to app: the clean, modern design and the security and privacy given by default.

I have skills in **graphic design**, **software development**, **web development**, and **audio and video editing.** I’m picking up **3D modeling** and **visual effects.** My projects page, [which can be viewed here](https://doamatto.xyz/projects), has plenty of links on archived, current, and concept projects.

I’ve been gaining an interest in homelabbing, privacy-focused tools that also use green energy, coalitions, Linux, and jailbreaking/rooting.
